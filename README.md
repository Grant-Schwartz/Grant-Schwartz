## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Grant Schwartz

I am the founder of Flow Fantasy Inc. - the world's first and only lacrosse company. Now, I'm looking for new challenges to solve. I will be attending Washington University in St. Louis next year, where I will be studying history, economics, and CS. I will also be playing lacrosse.

In the past, I've worked on an open-source project for NASA's Goddard Space Center in their Radio Jove project. The goal was to create easy to use software that enables citizen scientists (educators & students) to record data from radio telescopes.

If you have any questions regarding lacrosse statistics or anything, please feel free to reach out. I will be launching a personal website soon and will post it accordingly. Below are some ideas I'm going to work on.

- [ ] Minimalist project management designed for solo-devs
- [ ] A chrome extension to modernize WashU's WebSTAC
- [ ] Something to Unfuck the college process
- [ ] Documenting & Publishing lacrosse stats apis (PLL & College)
