ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Grant-Schwartz

I am the founder of Flow Fantasy Inc. - the world's first and only lacrosse company. Now, I'm looking for new challenges to solve. I will be attending Washington University in St. Louis next year, where I will be studying history, economics, and CS. I will also be playing lacrosse.
