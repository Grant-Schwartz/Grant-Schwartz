## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Grant Schwartz

I am the founder of Flow Fantasy Inc. - the world's first and only lacrosse company. Now, I'm looking for new challenges to solve. I will be attending Washington University in St. Louis next year, where I will be studying history, economics, and CS. I will also be playing lacrosse.

In the past, I've worked on an open-source project for NASA's Goddard Space Center in their Radio Jove project. The goal was to create easy to use software that enables citizen scientists (educators & students) to record data from radio telescopes.

If you have any questions regarding lacrosse statistics or anything, please feel free to reach out. I will be launching a personal website soon and will post it accordingly. Below are some ideas I might work on. We'll see

- [ ] Minimalist project management designed for solo-devs
- [ ] A chrome extension to modernize WashU's WebSTAC
- [ ] Something to Unfuck the college process
  - [ ] Help take useful notes on college tours
- [ ] Documenting & Publishing lacrosse stats apis (PLL & College)
- [ ] Something with night clubs (info + reviews)
- [ ] An service that texts college students what is going on on their campus every week
- [ ] A new stack the states game with more questions and updated ui
- [ ] Open source omni search library that can connect to a variety of DBs and fixtures
- [x] A well designed pocket constitution [found here](https://grantschwartz.xyz/posts/a-well-designed-constitution)
- [ ] Open source pantone
- [ ] Bring the pleasure of learning in the classroom to ordinary life
- [ ] 3D Map generator for video (see Johnny Harris) [name it Taranis]
- [ ] Lacrosse equipment equivalent of IKEA (cheap but good enough)
- [ ] Color scale generator (feed a color and recieve all different opacities as hex)
- [ ] An API for congressional stock buys/sells
- [ ] Heroku for ai modeling/training
