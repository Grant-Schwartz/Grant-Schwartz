ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Grant Schwartz

I am the founder of Flow Fantasy Inc. - the world's first and only lacrosse company. Now, I'm looking for new challenges to solve. I will be attending Washington University in St. Louis next year, where I will be studying history, economics, and CS. I will also be playing lacrosse.

If you have any questions regarding lacrosse statistics or anything, please feel free to reach out. I will be launching a personal website soon and will post it accordingly. Below are some ideas I'm going to work on.

[ ] Minimalist project management designed for solo-devs
[ ] A chrome extension to modernize WashU's WebSTAC
[ ] Something to Unfuck the college process
